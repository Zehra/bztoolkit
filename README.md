bzToolkit
=========

An external BZFlag plug-in API that consists of functions that are not in the official BZFS API due to them being too hackish or too simple but still should exist.

## How To Use
Add both bzToolkit header files to same directory as your plug-in and add `#include "bzToolkitAPI.h` to the top of your file after the `bzfsAPI.h` line and you are ready to use the toolkit's API in your plugin.

## Documentation
The documentation for the API functions can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/allejo/bztoolkit/wiki), which is regularly maintained and updated.
